# Viewing-Lighting-and-Shading
1.Fisrtly, the geometry of an approximate sphere was generated by tetrahedron subdivison. 
2.Object Related Controls: -Decreasing/increasing the number of tetrahedron subdivisions through buttons 
-Changing the diffuse color coefficients of the surface material using the sliders 
-Î²:Changing the shininess coefficient in the specular component of the shading equation. 
3.Camera related controls: Applying PERSPECTIVE projection. 
-FOVY: Changing the field of view angle (in degrees) in perspective projection. 
-Camera position X, Y, Z: Changing the camera position (eye point). 
4.Lighting related controls: -Changing the light position through sliders. 
-Shading type: Changing the shading type through a menu. 
Options of the menu are: 
i. Gouraud: Perform Gouraud (per vertex) shading. 
ii. Phong: Perform Phong (per fragment) shading. 
iii. Wireframe: Draw the wireframe representation of the sphere. 
The project purpose: Applying perspective projection along with per vertex and per fragment lighting.
