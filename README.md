# Viewing-Lighting-and-Shading
<b>1.Firstly, the geometry of an approximate sphere was generated by tetrahedron subdivison.</b><br /> 
<b>2.Object Related Controls: </b> <br />
-Decreasing/increasing the number of tetrahedron subdivisions through buttons. <br>
-Changing the diffuse color coefficients of the surface material using the sliders. <br>
-Î²:Changing the shininess coefficient in the specular component of the shading equation. <br>
<b>3.Camera related controls:Applying PERSPECTIVE projection.</b> <br>
-FOVY: Changing the field of view angle (in degrees) in perspective projection. <br>
-Camera position X, Y, Z: Changing the camera position (eye point). <br>
<b>4.Lighting related controls: -Changing the light position through sliders.</b> <br>
-Shading type: Changing the shading type through a menu. <br>
Options of the menu are: <br>
i. Gouraud: Perform Gouraud (per vertex) shading. <br>
ii. Phong: Perform Phong (per fragment) shading. <br>
iii. Wireframe: Draw the wireframe representation of the sphere. <br>
<b>The project purpose: Applying perspective projection along with per vertex and per fragment lighting.</b>
